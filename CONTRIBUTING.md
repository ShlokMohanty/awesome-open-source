# Contributing

Your contributions are always welcome!

## Guidelines

- Add one link per Pull Request.
  - Make sure the PR title is in the format of `Add project-name`.
  - Write down the reason why the library is awesome.
- Add the link: `* [project-name](http://example.com/) - A short description ends with a period.`
  - Keep descriptions concise and **short**.
- Add a programming language if needed.
  - Add the programming language title to Table of Contents.
- Search previous Pull Requests or Issues before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Don't mention `Open Source` in the description as it's implied.
- Follow the format in which the projects are maintained in the README.
- Don't write the website links, projects's public repository link of only Github/Bitbucket/Gitlab are allowed.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Remove any trailing whitespace.

Just a gentle reminder: **Try not to submit your own project. Instead, wait for someone finds it useful and submits it for you.**
